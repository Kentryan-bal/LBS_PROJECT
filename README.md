# LFS_PROJECT
This project involves the processing and exploratory analysis of the Philippines' Monthly Labor Force Survey (LFS) data from March 2023 to March 2024.

## What I Did
- **Data Integration**: Combined monthly LFS datasets across the specified time range.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Aligned column names after merging to ensure consistency.
  - Dropped null values.
  - Reset the index for a clean structure.
- **Feature Engineering**: Added new columns for more meaningful and efficient exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Employment vs. Unemployment rate per region.
  - Overall employment distribution across the country.
  - Identified the top 3 industries in the top 3 most employed regions.
- **Prepared Data for Statistical Testing**:
  - Used sample size data to generate new Excel files for ANOVA testing.

## Outputs
- Cleaned and enhanced LFS dataset
- Visualizations and insights from EDA
- Exported datasets ready for ANOVA tests
